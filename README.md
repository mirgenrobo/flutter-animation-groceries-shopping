# Flutter animation challenge 5 - Groceries shopping app

A Flutter animation implementation based on [Groceries Shopping App Interaction](https://dribbble.com/shots/6120171-Groceries-Shopping-App-Interaction).

## About
The app was created to simulate all the system behind the inspiration video. There's no code on backend or other web service. The app is all contained in this repository. The models classes was created to better representate an official development, the repositories classes are simulating a web request. I'm using BLOC pattern as architectural pattern.

Plus: removing order from cart list moving to right or left.
